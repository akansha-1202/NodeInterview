     <h1>Day 1</h1>

    <h3>1. What is NodeJs?</h3>
    <p>
      Node is a open-source, cross-platform run-time environment that allows you
      to run JS code on server-side, built on Chrome's V8 JS engine that execute
      JS outside the browser.
      <br />
      It is asynchronous and single-threaded in nature.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Why NodeJs is asynchronous in nature?</h3>
    <p>
      Bcz it performs non-blocking operations means it doesn't block the
      execution of further operation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. What is cross-platform, single-threaded and open-source?</h3>
    <p>
      OPEN-SOURCE means code that is designed to be accessible publically.
      <br />
      CROSS-PLATFORM means NodeJS code can be run on various platforms like MAC,
      Windows pr where Js is installed etc.
      <br />
      SINGLE-THREADED means it can perform only one task at a time.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Blocking vs Non-blocking</h3>
    <p>Blocking ==><br>It refers to the programs that blocks the execution of further operation until current operation finishes.<br> These methods are executed Synchronously means the program execute line by line and perform only one task at a time. The program waits until the called function returns some value, then on;y next task will execute. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Non-Blocking ==><br> It refers to the program that doesn't block the execution of further operation.<br> These methods are executed Asynchronously means program will not execute line by line. The program doesn't wait for time-consuming task to complete and move on to the next task. The time-consuming task will execute in background while rest of the code continue to execute.</p>

    <h3>5. What is NPM?</h3>
    <p>
      NPM stands for Node Package Manager.
      <br />
      It comes in-built along with NodeJS.
      <br />
      Main two functions of npm are :<br />
      1. It works as an online repository for NodeJS modules/packages so that
      everyone can share tools written in Js.
      <br />
      2. It works on command-line utility to install packages, to do version
      managment and dependencies managment of NodeJs packages.
    </p>

    <h3>6. What is Module?</h3>
    <p>
      Module is a small unit of independent, reusable code that is desired to be
      used as a building block.
      <br />
      It can be import and export.
      <br />
      Types of modules are :
      <br />
      1. Built-in Modules ==> Modules that we can use without installation like
      fs, http, url, path
      <br />
      2. Local/User-define Modules ==> Modules that we created locally in NodeJs
      App.
      <br />
      3. Third Party Modules ==> Modules that we can use after installation like
      express, cors, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt etc.
      <br /><br />
      Each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module, and you can define
      what parts of the module (variables, functions, objects, etc.) should be
      accessible to other modules using the module.exports or exports object.
    </p>

    <h3>7. What is the purpose of "module.exports" in NodeJS?</h3>
    <p>
      "module.exports" is a special object used to define public interface. If
      we want to export some variable, functions and objects from one module to
      another module, we use "module.exports".
    </p>

    <h3>8. Difference between default export and named export.</h3>
    <p>
      DEFAULT EXPORT ==> It allows you to export single value from a module
      which can be imported with any name in another module.
      <br />
      NAMED EXPORT ==> It allows you to export multiple values from a module and
      each value must be imported using its exact name inside curly in another
      module.
    </p>

    <h3>9. How do you import any module in Node.js?</h3>
    <p>
      When we want to import any variable, function and object fom one module to
      another in NodeJS, we use "require()" function.
      <br />
      "require()" is a in-built function that allows you to include external
      modules that exist in separate JS files. It basically read a Js file,
      execute it and then proceeds to return the export object.
    </p>

      <h3>10. Difference between HTTP and HTTPS</h3>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
                <th></th>

                <td>It doesn't uses encryption which results low security.</td>
                <td>It uses encryption which results better security than 
                    HTTP.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>4.</th>
                <td>HTTP speed is faster than HTTPS.</td>
                <td>HTTPS speed is slower than HTTP.</td>

                <td>It works on Transport Layer of OSI Model.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>11. What are the different types of HTTP requests?</h3>
        <p>
            The different types of HTTP requests that we use most frequently are:
        <ul>
            <li>POST ==> Used to create a new resource on the server.</li>
            <li>GET ==> Used to read a resource from the server.</li>
            <li>PUT/PATCH ==> Both are used to update the existing resource but the differnce is that PUT updates the whole resource and PATCH only update a part of resource specified in request, leaving rest unchanged.</li>
            <li>DELETE ==> USed to delete a specified resource on the server.</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
        

       <h3>12. Create a simple server using HTTP.</h3>
       <pre>
         const http = require("http");

         const app = http.createServer((req, res)=>{
            console.log("Hello")
            res.write("I am SErver")
            res.end()
         })

         app.listen(3000,()=>{
            console.log("Server is running...!!")
         })
       </pre>

       <h3>13. What is Express? How it helps you to create a backend application? Advantages of using express.</h3>
       <p>EXpress is a lightweight and unopinionated web application framework that runs on NodeJs.The MAIN purpose of Express is to simplify and speed up the process of building robust backend app and APIs.
        <br>
        It helps in making backend app by providing a set tools amd features that make a easier to handle routing, manage http req and res, work with middlewares and making the development process more efficent and organized.   
       </p>

       <h3>16. What is CORS?</h3>
       <p>CORS stands for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing.<br>
        CORS is a permission slip that websites give to each other to share data and resource safely. It bypass the browser's security rule called SOP(Same Origin Policy) so that websites from diffrent origin can work together easily.
      </p>

       <h3>17. Explain the concept of Middleware in Node.js</h3>
       <p>Middleware is a function that access request object(req) , response object(res) and access the next middleware function in req-res application cycle.<br>
        It accept three parameter i.e., request, response, next function<br>
        Middleware can cancel the request in mid of the cycle.<br>
        Types of Application :<br>
        1. Application level middleware ==> app.use("") <br>
        2. Routing Middleware ==> router.use("") <br>
        3. Error Handling Middleware
      
      </p>


      <h3> 18. Create a middleware which will be applicable to all the routes.</h3>
      <pre>
        const express = require("express")
        const app = express()
       

        const middleware = (req,res,next)=>{
          if(req.query.age>=18){
            console.log("You can access this file.")
            next()
          }
          else{
            console.log("You can't access this file.")
          }
        }

        //When you want to apply middleware to all routes
        app.use(middleware)   

        app.get("/html",(req,res)=>{
          res.send("HTML File")
        })

        app.get("/css",(req,res)=>{
          res.send("CSS File")
        })

        //When you want to apply specific route
        app.get("/js", middleware,(req,res)=>{      
          res.send("JS File")
        })

      <h3>19. Implementation of all type of exports in backend application</h3>
      <pre>
        <p>1. Exporting a Function(Named Export):</p>
        
        //export.js
        function add(a,b){
          return a+b
        }

        module.exports = add


        //import.js
        const addition = require("./export")
        
        const result1 = addition(4,8)
        console.log(result1)  //12

        <p>2. Exporting a Single Value(Export default):</p>

        //export.js
        function add(a,b){
          return a+b
        }

        function sub(a,b){
          return a-b
        }

        module.exports = {
          add,
          sub
        }


        //import.js
        const {add,sub} = require("./export")

        const result2 = add(2,1)
        console.log(result2)

        const result3 = sub(2,1)
        console.log(result3)

        <p>Or we can also import "add , sub" as:</p>
        const calc = require("./export")

        const result2 = calc.add(2,1)
        console.log(result2)

        const result3 = calc.sub(2,1)
        console.log(result3)


        <p>3. Exporting as a Named Property:</p>

        //export.js
        exports.blogList = () =>{
          const list = ["Bollywood", "Hollywood"]
          return list
        }

        //import.js
        const {blogList} = require("./export")

        const result4 = blogList()
        console.log(result4)

        <p>Or we can also import "blogList" as:</p>
        const blogModule = require("./export")

        const result4 = blogModule.blogList()
        console.log(result4)     
      </pre>

      <h3>20. What are JWT tokens?</h3>
      <p>JWT stands for JSON Web Token, a secure way to transmit information between two parties in the form of a compact JSON object.<br>
         It is widely used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs. JWTs are stateless, secure, and efficient.<br>
         JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are: header, payload, and signature.<br>
        A JWT typically looks like the following : xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz<br>
        The header contains metadata, the payload has claims about the user, and the signature ensures integrity</p>

      <h3>21. Define Headers,Payload, Signature </h3>
    
        <li>Headers ==> The header is the first part of a JWT and contains metadata, including the token's type and the signing algorithm used.</li>
        <pre>
          {
            "alg": "HS256",
            "typ": "JWT"
          }         
        </pre>
        <li>Payload ==>  The payload is the second part of a JWT and contains the user's information and additional data in JSON format.</li>
        <pre>
          {
            "sub": "1234567890",
            "name": "John Doe",
            "iat": 1516239022
          }       
        </pre>
        <li>Signature ==> The signature is the third part of a JWT and is used to verify the token's authenticity and integrity. It is generated using the header, payload, a secret key, and the specified signing algorithm.</li>
        <br>
        The structure of a JWT looks like this: <span style="color: red;"> xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</span>
        where,
        <li>xxxxx is the Base64Url encoded header.</li>
        <li>yyyyy is the Base64Url encoded payload.</li>
         <li>zzzzz is the signature.</li>
         <br>

        By combining the header, payload, and signature, JWTs provide a secure and compact way to transmit information between parties and are widely used for authentication and authorization in modern web applications and APIs.

      <h3>22. How do you send the email with Express ?</h3>
      <p>
        To send emails with Express, you can use a library called "nodemailer", which provides a simple way to send emails from your Node.js application.
      </p>


      <h3>23. What is callback in node.js?</h3>
      <p>In Node.js, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are a fundamental aspect of asynchronous programming in Node.js and play a significant role in handling non-blocking operations.</p>


      <h3>24. What is http Module?</h3>
      <p>The "http" module is a core module in Node.js that provides functionality for creating HTTP servers and making HTTP requests. It allows you to build web servers, handle incoming HTTP requests, and send HTTP requests to external resources.</p>


      <h3>25. How does react communicate with Node?</h3>
      <p>React communicate with NodeJs using broweser's in-built "fetch" function or third-party libraries like "axios".</p>
