    <h1>1. What is NodeJs?</h1>
    <p>
      Node is a open-source, cross-platform run-time environment that allows you
      to run JS code on server-side, built on Chrome's V8 JS engine that execute
      JS outside the browser.
      <br />
      It is asynchronous and single-threaded in nature.
    </p>

    <h1>2. Why NodeJs is asynchronous in nature?</h1>
    <p>
      Bcz it performs non-blocking operations means it doesn't block the
      execution of further operation.
    </p>

    <h1>3. What is cross-platform, single-threaded and open-source?</h1>
    <p>
      OPEN-SOURCE means code that is designed to be accessible publically.
      <br />
      CROSS-PLATFORM means NodeJS code can be run on various platforms like MAC,
      Windows pr where Js is installed etc.
      <br />
      SINGLE-THREADED means it can perform only one task at a time.
    </p>

    <h1>4. Blocking vs Non-blocking</h1>
    <p>Blocking ==><br>It refers to the programs that blocks the execution of further operation until current operation finishes.<br> These methods are executed Synchronously means the program execute line by line and perform only one task at a time. The program waits until the called function returns some value, then on;y next task will execute. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Non-Blocking ==><br> It refers to the program that doesn't block the execution of further operation.<br> These methods are executed Asynchronously means program will not execute line by line. The program doesn't wait for time-consuming task to complete and move on to the next task. The time-consuming task will execute in background while rest of the code continue to execute.</p>

    <h1>5. What is NPM?</h1>
    <p>
      NPM stands for Node Package Manager.
      <br />
      It comes in-built along with NodeJS.
      <br />
      Main two functions of npm are :<br />
      1. It works as an online repository for NodeJS modules/packages so that
      everyone can share tools written in Js.
      <br />
      2. It works on command-line utility to install packages, to do version
      managment and dependencies managment of NodeJs packages.
    </p>

    <h1>6. What is Module?</h1>
    <p>
      Module is a small unit of independent, reusable code that is desired to be
      used as a building block.
      <br />
      It can be import and export.
      <br />
      Types of modules are :
      <br />
      1. Built-in Modules ==> Modules that we can use without installation like
      fs, http, url, path
      <br />
      2. Local/User-define Modules ==> Modules that we created locally in NodeJs
      App.
      <br />
      3. Third Party Modules ==> Modules that we can use after installation like
      express, cors, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt etc.
      <br /><br />
      Each file in Node.js is treated as a separate module, and you can define
      what parts of the module (variables, functions, objects, etc.) should be
      accessible to other modules using the module.exports or exports object.
    </p>

    <h1>7. What is the purpose of "module.exports" in NodeJS?</h1>
    <p>
      "module.exports" is a special object used to define public interface. If
      we want to export some variable, functions and objects from one module to
      another module, we use "module.exports".
    </p>

    <h1>8. Difference between default export and named export.</h1>
    <p>
      DEFAULT EXPORT ==> It allows you to export single value from a module
      which can be imported with any name in another module.
      <br />
      NAMED EXPORT ==> It allows you to export multiple values from a module and
      each value must be imported using its exact name inside curly in another
      module.
    </p>

    <h1>9. How do you import any module in Node.js?</h1>
    <p>
      When we want to import any variable, function and object fom one module to
      another in NodeJS, we use "require()" function.
      <br />
      "require()" is a in-built function that allows you to include external
      modules that exist in separate JS files. It basically read a Js file,
      execute it and then proceeds to return the export object.
    </p>

      <h1>10. Difference between HTTP and HTTPS</h1>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
                <th></th>

                <td>It uses encryption which results better security than 
                    HTTP.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>4.</th>
                <td>HTTP speed is faster than HTTPS.</td>

        <h1>11. What are the different types of HTTP requests?</h1>
        <p>
            The different types of HTTP requests that we use most frequently are:
        <ul>
            <li>POST ==> Used to send data to the server.</li>
            <li>GET ==> Used to read data from the server.</li>
            <li>PUT/PATCH ==> Both are used to update the data but the differnce is that PUT updates the whole resource and PATCH only update a part of resource specified in request, leaving rest unchanged.</li>
            <li>DELETE ==> USed to delete a specified resource on the server.</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
        

       <h1>12. Create a simple server using HTTP.</h1>
       <pre>
         const http = require("http");

         const app = http.createServer((req, res)=>{
            console.log("Hello")
            res.write("I am SErver")
            res.end()
         })

         app.listen(3000,()=>{
            console.log("Server is running...!!")
         })
       </pre>

       <h1>13. What is Express? How it helps you to create a backend application? Advantages of using express.</h1>
       <p>EXpress is a lightweight and unopinionated web application framework that runs on NodeJs.The MAIN purpose of Express is to simplify and speed up the process of building robust backend app and APIs.
        <br>
        It helps in making backend app by providing a set tools amd features that make a easier to handle routing, manage http req and res, work with middlewares and making the development process more efficent and organized.   
       </p>

       <pre>
        const express= require("express")
        const app = express()

        })
